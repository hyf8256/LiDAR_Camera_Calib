**Calib_1-4.exe**
This demonstrates the calibration process:

I.Edge extraction of the target plate in the imageâ€”combining manual marking can yield more accurate results;
II.Extraction of the target point cloud of the target plate from the scene point cloud, denoted as PC_t;
III.Edge extraction of the target point cloud from II, denoted as PC_edge_t;
IV.Fitting the ground truth edge of the target plate to the current edge point cloud from III, denoted as gt_t.
